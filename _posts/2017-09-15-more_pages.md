## Welcome to She-Pages in September
I think this is a blog for women- and if you feel like a lady, I won't tell you otherwise. But it certainly doesn’t exclude men.

### Learning a New Lifestyle.

Learning a new skill can sometimes turn into a new way of living. When the two are intertwined the challenge seems all the greater. What I didn’t realize was that coding was a way of life. For some reason, although I had seen the correlation between computer geeks and a unique way of being, I had not realized that **the computer makes the geek as the geek makes the computer**. 
The one cannot exist without the other.

For some strange reason, I had not realized that programming was a lifestyle. Although I had known a few professional programmers over the years, the cause and effect was not clear. I had attributed a lifestyle to a specific group behavior/individual behaviors rather seeing that certain professions require certain choices. Much like a tennis player who has to follow a certain type of diet, or training schedule, a programmer has to work on his craft (I don’t say “her craft” because there are still few women in this field, and they are used to being treated this way! By the way this is a joke.) Yet women and computers are still far from being close bedfellows.

## Why start a blog now? Don’t we have enough personal transformative narratives on the web?
Yes and no. At some unclear moment I realized that I only knew how to be a good consumer. All I could do with my computer was: buy, like or friend (according to someone else's parameters), find what an search engine decided was the most popular, install what others told me was compatible, watch what was in my geographic permited zone. If I wanted any kind of say in how or what I was offered on the web, I would have to change my lifestyle. My lack of computer knowledge may be due to my generation. When I was in college in the 1990s there were very few women working in/with computers. Yet, when I look at most of the 20 year olds around me, they seemed more tech-saavy at first. With a closer look I see they are no different. In fact they are only saavy consumers. Very few really create/produce/modify anything beyond the predetermined program's paremeters. I wish to explore and document this journey to Wonderland, where I can start to try and write some of the rules.
