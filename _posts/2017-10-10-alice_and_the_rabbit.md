### Welcome to She-Pages in September but that I didnt get up until October
I think this is a blog for women- and if you feel like a lady, I won't tell you otherwise. But it certainly doesn’t exclude men.

### Learning a New Lifestyle.

Learning a new skill can sometimes turn into a new way of living. When the two are intertwined the challenge seems all the greater. What I didn’t realize was that coding was a way of life. For some reason, although I had seen the correlation between computer geeks and a unique way of being, I had not realized that *the computer makes the geek as the geek makes the computer*. 
The one cannot exist without the other.

 I had not realized that programming was in fact lifestyle, and perhaps even more. Although I had known several professional programmers over the years, (countless evenings of geeks on my couch with only the clicking sound of keys) the cause and effect was not clear. I had attributed a way of seeing the world [(Weltanschauung)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_view) to a specific group behavior and often to one individual's behaviors. I had trouble understanding that certain professions require certain choices. Much like a tennis player who has to follow a certain type of diet, or training schedule, a programmer has to work on his craft (I don’t say “her craft” because there are still few women in this field, this is a topic for another day and merits more than the simple observation of gender imbalance.) 

### Why start a blog now? Don’t we have enough personal transformative narratives and tech-blogs? - Yes and no.
At some unclear moment I realized that I only knew how to be a good consumer. All I could do with my computer was: buy things, "like" or friend (according to someone else's parameters), find what a search engine decided was the most popular, install what others told me was compatible, watch what was in my geographic permited zone and the list of restrictions goes on and on. If I wanted to have any kind of say in the matter, I would have to change my habits and learn new skills for becoming an actor rather than a passive consumer. 

I have often told myself that my lack of computer knowledge may be due to my generation. (It troubles me to think that it is due to laziness or apathy.) Often I look at most of the 20-year-olds around me; at first they seemed more tech-saavy with their phones harmonized to their latest mood; and connected to a peer hive of phones buzzing with activity. With a closer look I see they are no different from me. In fact they are only saavy consumers. Very few of them truly know how to create or produce, or even modify anything beyond the predetermined program's paremeters. 
My modest goal with this blog is to document my tech-headaches and use it as a lab for experimenting. I wish to explore a world where I can start to write some of the rules.
Like Alice I am ready to jump down the rabit hole and see where it goes....
